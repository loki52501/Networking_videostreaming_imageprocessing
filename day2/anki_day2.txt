Q: What is the purpose of a ring buffer in a video pipeline?
A: To decouple producer and consumer timing: smooth jitter, reduce blocking, and provide fixed memory usage.

Q: When should a producer wait in a producer-consumer system?
A: When the buffer is full.

Q: When should a consumer wait in a producer-consumer system?
A: When the buffer is empty.

Q: What's the difference between a mutex and a condition variable?
A: Mutex protects shared data; condition variable lets threads wait for a state change.

Q: What are three strategies when capture is faster than processing?
A: Drop frames, increase buffer size, scale processing (more workers/GPU).
