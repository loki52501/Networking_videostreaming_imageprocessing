# Day 3 Reflection Template

Write at least 150 words across these sections. Anchor every claim in data or observations from your experiments.

## 1. TCP Reliability vs Real-Time Needs
- Explain a scenario where TCP's guarantees harmed streaming responsiveness.
- Reference specific metrics (latency spike, backlog size, etc.).

## 2. Jitter and Viewer Experience
- Describe how jitter manifested in your measurements.
- Connect the variance to perceived playback smoothness or control latency.

## 3. Buffering Strategy Trade-offs
- Discuss how much buffering you would tolerate for the observed network conditions.
- Note any thresholds beyond which the experience degraded.

## 4. Encryption Overheads
- Hypothesise or measure how AES-GCM (or similar) would alter timing.
- Consider CPU cost, packet sizing, and potential head-of-line blocking.

## 5. Next Iteration
- Identify the single most valuable improvement for tomorrow.
- Include any open questions for future investigation.
