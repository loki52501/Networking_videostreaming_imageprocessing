# Balanced Tree Lab – Day 5 Extension

Goal: design and implement your own AVL and Red-Black trees from scratch. This folder keeps high-level guidance only—fill in the real code inside your own source files once you understand the steps.

## Suggested Flow
1. Read `avl_task.md` to plan rotations and height bookkeeping.
2. Build a quick test harness that inserts random keys and validates order.
3. Once AVL works, switch to `red_black_task.md` and extend the concepts to color balancing.
4. Write your final implementations in separate `.cpp/.hpp` files (e.g., `avl_tree.cpp`, `rb_tree.cpp`).

Keep notes in your Day 5 journal about invariants, rotations, and test strategies.
