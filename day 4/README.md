# Day 4 — Cognitive Bridge

## Overview
- [ ] Review matrix operations in deep learning (dot products, matmul, broadcasting)
- [ ] Read Goodfellow Ch. 6 §§6.3–6.5 (matrix calculus + backprop)
- [ ] Read NVIDIA blog on GPU matrix multiplies
- [ ] Sketch the producer/consumer ? neural network analogy

## Schedule (suggested)
| Block | Duration | Focus | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conceptual Deep Dive | 2 h | Matrix math, computation graphs | Capture takeaways below |
| Coding Lab | 2 h | Manual + threaded matmul | Use `matmul_lab.py`
| Systems Link | 1 h | Specialized hardware overview | Note CPU vs GPU reflections |
| Reflection | 1 h | Journal prompts | Update `Day 4 Journal.md`
| Optional Challenge | 30+ min | Mini distributed training sim | Track wait times, bottlenecks |

## Deliverables
- [ ] Completed timing comparison (manual vs `np.dot`)
- [ ] Thread-scaling notes (1 ? 4 threads)
- [ ] Reflection answers recorded
- [ ] Optional challenge results (if attempted)
